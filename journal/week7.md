# Week 7 â€” Solving CORS with a Load Balancer and Custom Domain

## Technical Tasks
In the class, we are going to:

ðŸ‘‰ *Create a [Route53 hosted zone](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/hosted-zones-working-with.html) to manage our domain

ðŸ‘‰ Generate a public certificate via [AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/gs-acm-request-public.html)

ðŸ‘‰ Create an [Application Load Balancer (ALB)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/create-application-load-balancer.html)

ðŸ‘‰ Create ALB target group that points to our Fargate instances

ðŸ‘‰ Update our application to handle CORS
 
*We need a domain name, so you need to either purchase a domain name or use a free domain name eg. freenom. Domain names take time to create and propagate, so you have mandatory homework, or weâ€™ll have an extra half-class just for domains between weeks 6 and 7.
