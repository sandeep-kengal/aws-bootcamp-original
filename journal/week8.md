# Week 8 — Serverless Image Processing

## Technical Tasks
In the class, we are going to:

👉 Test our JavaScript code to use [Sharp](https://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/) and process a thumbnail

👉 Write an [AWS Lambda](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-nodejs.html) function

👉 Deploy our Lambda function

👉 Create an [S3 Bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/create-bucket-overview.html)

👉 Create an [S3 Event Notification](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/how-to-enable-disable-notification-intro.html) to process images upload to S3 and deposit them back in the bucket

👉 Implement basic file upload to S3 client-side


## Business Scenario
```
The CEO shared our private beta web-application with our investor and shared it with their internal network, and the immediate feedback was, “how do I upload my own profile photo?”

The CEO has asked that we implement this immediately.
