# Week 5 â€” DynamoDB and Serverless Caching
## Technical Tasks
In the class, we are going to:

ðŸ‘‰ Have a lecture about data modeling (Single Table Design) for NoSQL

ðŸ‘‰ Launch [DynamoDB local](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/DynamoDBLocal.html)

ðŸ‘‰ Seed our DynamoDB tables with data using [Faker](https://faker.readthedocs.io/en/master/)

ðŸ‘‰ Write [AWS SDK code for DynamoDB](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/code-library/latest/ug/python_3_dynamodb_code_examples.html) to query and scan put-item, for predefined endpoints

ðŸ‘‰ Create a production DynamoDB table

ðŸ‘‰ Update our backend app to use the production DynamoDB

ðŸ‘‰ Add a caching layer using [Momento Severless Cache](https://github.com/momentohq/client-sdk-python)

## Business Scenario
```
The CEO has a very personal relationship with our primary investor, and the CEO is meeting up next week with the investor and wants to surprise them by showing that we already have a working application.

The fractional CTO has suggested that we hook up the most basic parts of the application with dummy data so that the CEO can use the Gitpod environment to launch the environment on their laptop and do a very limited demo with an emphasis that the data is backed by a real database.

The CEO wants to impress upon us that our implementation can also scale to millions of users, so the CTO has suggested that we use Amazon DynamoDB because it has a guarantee of performance at any scale based on setting a read and write capacity for a specific cost.

The CEO feels that the investor is going to ask how much this NoSQL database is going to cost at scale, and pressed the fractional CTO to crunch the numbers on the spot. The CEO was then shocked at the cost and asked for ways to curb this cost, and so that the fractional CTO can bring down repetitive costs by using a read-aside cache.

Even though the project does not require right not a read-aside cache, the fractional CTO said to implement the easiest, fastest and cost-effective implementation to appease the CEO request.

```
## Weekly Outcome
```
âœ… Be able to data model using single table design
âœ… Basic knowledge of working with a cloud SDK
âœ… Basic implementation of read-aside cache in front of a database
âœ… Interact with a production NoSQL database
âœ… Basic knowledge of working with an OLTP

```
## [Possible Spend Considerations](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10Hec7Or1ZUedl0ye-05mVPhYFR5-ySh2K8ZbFqTxu1w/edit#bookmark=id.x1c0q89oefl4)
```
ðŸ‘‰ DynamoDB provisioned capacity
ðŸ‘‰ CloudWatch Alarms generated by DynamoDB (DDB)
ðŸ‘‰ Momento free-tier limit

```
## Alternatives and Considerations
```
ðŸ“Ž DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) could have been used an alternative to Momento
ðŸ“Ž Amazon ElastiCache could have been used but decided against using ElastiCache due the time to provision, the limitations around having to be in the same VPC as our workload, and some of Redis configurations are prone to time-consuming troubleshooting with client libraries
ðŸ“Ž Momento was chosen because it requires no provisioning, we will use it likely for more than one use-case, (both SQL and NoSQL), I want to include a third-party service so we can talk about how we deal with non-aws services when using CFN, I want to teach the practice of caching, but spend tons of time dealing with caching services.
ðŸ“Ž Caching is not just for cost-savings, but often for improved performance (queries return faster) or avoid read and write contention (too many queries that make the database unresponsive)

```

## Security Considerations

TBD
