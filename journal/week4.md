# Week 4 â€” Postgres and RDS

## Technical Tasks
In the class, we are going to:

ðŸ‘‰ Have a lecture about data modelling in (3rd Normal Form) 3NF for SQL

ðŸ‘‰ Launch Postgres locally via a container

ðŸ‘‰ Seed our Postgres Database table with data

ðŸ‘‰ Write a Postgres adapter

ðŸ‘‰ Write a DDL (for creating schema)

ðŸ‘‰ Write an SQL read query

ðŸ‘‰ Write an SQL write query

ðŸ‘‰ Provision an [RDS Postgres instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_PostgreSQL.html)

ðŸ‘‰ Configure [VPC Security Groups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_SecurityGroups.html)

ðŸ‘‰ Configure local backend application to use production connection URL

ðŸ‘‰ Add a caching layer using Momento Serverless Cache

ðŸ‘‰ Propagate metrics from DDB to an RDS metrics table 

## Business Scenario
```
The CEO met with the primary investor and demoed the web-application. The CEO feels the investor was impressed with our rapid development progress thus far.

The primary investor asked us how we plan to track platform growth. The CEO said that we had already begun implementation on basic tracking growth metrics within a backend dashboard of our platform:
ðŸ—¹  How many users are on the platform
ðŸ—¹  How many posts are on the platform
ðŸ—¹  How many new users per day for the last week
ðŸ—¹  How many new posts per day for the last week

The CEO is going to meet again with the primary investor next week, and the CEO wants us to deliver on their spur-of-the-moment promise. So we need to rapidly deliver a simple dashboard with platform metrics.

To keep up with the pace of feature development, the CTO has suggested we use Postgres as a relational database. Since our backend does not require the same scale as the customer-facing part of our application.

```
## Weekly Outcome
```
âœ… Be able to data model using 3rd normal forms
âœ… Practical working knowledge of utilizing a Postgres database
âœ… Basic knowledge of working with an Online Analytical Processing (OLAP)

```
## [Possible Spend Considerations](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10Hec7Or1ZUedl0ye-05mVPhYFR5-ySh2K8ZbFqTxu1w/edit#bookmark=id.z4yyfmaafnom)
```
ðŸ‘‰ RDS instance
ðŸ‘‰ RDS Snapshots
ðŸ‘‰ Momento free-tier limit


```
## Alternatives and Considerations
```
ðŸ“Ž We require a Postgres service if we plan into AuthN which will rely on Postgres to store users for authentication.
ðŸ“Ž I want both an OnLine Transaction Processing (OLTP) and an OLAP in this project
Redshift Serverless could be used as an OLAP
ðŸ“Ž DDB Streams to S3 and then Athena caching to Momento could have been possible as well for our OLAP like solution

```

## Security Considerations
```
TBD
