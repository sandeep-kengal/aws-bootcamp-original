# Week 3 â€” Decentralized Authentication

## Technical Tasks
In the class, we are going to:

```
ðŸ‘‰ Provision via ClickOps a Amazon Cognito User Pool
ðŸ‘‰ Install and configure Amplify client-side library for Amazon Congito
ðŸ‘‰ Implement API calls to Coginto in custom login, signup page
ðŸ‘‰ Show conditional elements and data based on logged in or logged out

```
## Business Scenario
```
The fractional CTO has suggested that authentication be solved before implementing any other business logic in the application and to ensure that we use a decentralized authentication service and specifically Amazon Cognito. 
```
## Weekly Outcome
```
âœ…Practical knowledge of implementing a decentralized authentication service into a web-application with custom login and signup pages in a react application.
```
## [Possible Spend Considerations](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10Hec7Or1ZUedl0ye-05mVPhYFR5-ySh2K8ZbFqTxu1w/edit#bookmark=id.ykmfzr7f5ttu)
```
ðŸ‘‰ TBD
```
## Alternatives and Considerations
```
ðŸ“Ž We could have used Auth0 which is a popular decentralized authentication service which has a free-tier. Since we are building a social media website we have to consider the cost of Monthly Active Users (MAUs)
ðŸ“Ž In practice a social media platform would likely roll its own decentralized authentication service
AuthN would have put on a good technical path to roll own decentralized authentication service however it requires Postgres and Redis so it would be too many extra moving parts and costs considerations for the scope of this bootcamp
ðŸ“Ž Azure AD B2C is another possible solution. Its low cost has support for many Identity Providers (IpDs)
